# Zero Vue

This is the official repo for the VueJS tutorial mini-series over on [Dev The Web]().

This repo contains the starter files and then continues with a branch for each continual part of the series. To move to the next part of the course, use `git checkout part-x`. For example, to skip the first part of the tutorials and move straight to the starter files for part 2, use: `git checkout part-2`.
